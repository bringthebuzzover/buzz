# Buzz

**Bring the Buzz Over** is a specialized marketing platform built to connect brands with the unique, often hard-to-reach communities found on college campuses.

Buzz moves beyond traditional "cold ads" by leveraging the existing social fabric of universities. Rather than generic marketing, Buzz partners brands with established student organizations—such as Greek life chapters, athletic teams, and academic or social clubs—to enable more authentic campus engagement.

For brands, Buzz offers a centralized system to manage student-led campaigns across multiple colleges. Brands can handle approvals, and measure real-world engagement and on-the-ground impact—all within a single workflow.

For student organizations, Buzz acts as a marketplace where groups can find opportunities to collaborate with brands. They can access exclusive products, brand perks, and sponsored campaigns, allowing them to monetize their influence and share offerings that resonate with their mission.

At the core is the **BUZZ platform**: a technology suite that connects brands and student groups. It acts as a project management and discovery tool that allows marketing campaigns to scale across a network of top-tier institutions, including Cornell, Stanford, Harvard, Princeton, and MIT. The platform is designed to ensure that marketing feels organic and student-led rather than corporate-driven.

# Product Specification

This document describes Buzz’s product architecture, user experiences, lifecycle rules, data flow, and interactions. It reflects the intended behavior for the current product direction.

---

## 1. Executive summary

Buzz serves **two separate platform experiences** that intentionally do not overlap for real users:

| Dimension                  | Brands                                                          | Student organizations                                                                                     |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Go-to-market               | Sales-led (PLS)                                                 | Product-led (PLG) / sales-led (greek-life partnerships)                                                   |
| Onboarding                 | Sales-led ; Buzz reviews and onboards                           | **Login with Instagram**; profile + verified university **.edu** email, then **Buzz admin approval**, grants portal access (**§3.1**, **§6.1**) |
| Scheduling / participation | Buzz coordinates ops; brands **batch-finalize** applicants after `apply_close_at` (§7.1) | Orgs discover campaigns, can enable notifications to be reminded when they drop, and apply (§6.3, §7)     |
| Primary portal             | Status tracker + KPI dashboards + content library               | Drop feed + campaign history                                                                              |
| Analytics lens             | Per-drop, aggregate across drops, engagement over time          | Own posts + aggregate engagement per active campaign                                                      |
| Motion                     | Representative-driven                                           | Self-serve signup (Instagram + **.edu** verification)                                                     |

**Key product rule:** A real user belongs to **exactly one** portal (Brand **or** Organization). Internal operators may use admin **View as** (impersonation) to open an org or brand session — that is not a production multi-portal capability.

---

## 2. Terminology

- **Brand:** A company partner using Buzz in a sales-assisted model.
- **Organization (Org):** A student organization using Buzz in a self-serve model.
- **Drop:** A campaign instance with capacity, application windows, and lifecycle states visible differently to brands vs. orgs.
- **Campaign (org context):** An org’s participation in a specific drop (application through completion).
- **Spot:** One org slot in a drop’s fixed capacity.
- **Buzz / Admin:** Internal operators who onboard brands and orgs to the platform, move brand **drop-request** tracker stages, manage agreements and exception handling, and operate behind the scenes where the product does not give the brand a direct control.
- **Drop applicant decisions:** After the application window closes, the **brand** **batch-finalizes** applicants (approve or deny up to capacity). Rules: **§7.1**. No accept writes while the chronological Open window is still running.

---

## 3. Access and identity

### 3.1 Production behavior

- No end user may belong to **both** the Brand portal and the Organization portal.
- Routing and permissions enforce a **single portal** per authenticated user.
- **Organization users** sign in with **Login with Instagram** (Instagram is the account identity for the org portal). The Instagram account used at login **is** the organization account (Business/Creator); the org handle is not separately choosable.
- On first signup, the org completes a short profile—**university**, **org name**, \# of members, address, and a **university .edu email**—and must **verify** that email, then await **Buzz admin approval**, before the Organization portal grants access. Until approval, the user remains in a pending state (no full portal access).

### 3.1.1 Data ownership (single source of truth)

Each fact is stored once; APIs may still expose familiar field names by joining the owner table.

| Fact | Owner column | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Org Instagram identity | `users.instagram_username` | Exposed as `instagramHandle` on org profile / applicant rows |
| Org `.edu` email | `users.edu_email` | Unique login/verification identity; not editable via `PATCH /orgs/me` |
| Brand display name | `brands.brand_name` | Drop/campaign responses join brand for `brandName` |
| Campaign tracking number | `drops.tracking_number` | One TN per drop; org/brand/admin surfaces read the drop |
| Post↔campaign membership | `drop_applications.drop_id` | Links/suggestions reference `application_id` only |

`organizations` holds club profile metadata (name, campus, address, etc.). `brands.instagram_handle` remains a separate brand-side field used for autolink caption matching.

### 3.2 Demo / internal preview

Production users cannot switch portals. Internal operators use admin **View as** (impersonation) to open an org or brand session; see [`TESTING.md`](TESTING.md) / [`DEPLOYMENT.md`](DEPLOYMENT.md).

---

## 4. Drops — shared concepts

### 4.1 Capacity & application window (timing)

Each drop has a **fixed maximum number of organization spots** (e.g. 10). Drops may also carry an **optional total product unit budget** (`total_product_units` — **nullable** when units are unknown or not applicable at request time) that brands distribute across approved orgs during **batch finalize** after the window closes (**§7.1**). Multiple orgs may **apply** while the drop is **Open**. During Open, applications stay **pending review** — brands do **not** accept or deny while `now <= apply_close_at`.

For v1, drops expose two timestamps:

| Field            | Purpose                                                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `apply_open_at`  | When applications open; drives **Upcoming** → **Open** transition for org UX and countdown before open. |
| `apply_close_at` | When the application window ends; after this, brands **batch-finalize** applicants (**§7.1**).          |

**Timing outcomes:** When `apply_close_at` passes, the window **auto-closes** (no new applications under the open window). After auto-close or any other closure, **Buzz** may **manually reopen** (admin UX TBD). Capacity-**Closed** on the org feed (approved orgs fill all spots) is a **post-selection** outcome — or a **reopened** window with prior accepts already counting toward capacity — not a first-window Open path (**§7.2**). These timestamps also drive org feed states (**§6.3**).

### 4.2 Post attribution (hard constraint)

- A single **social media post** (one canonical post identity on a platform) may be linked to **at most one** campaign (one org’s participation in one drop).
- The system must prevent double-assignment across campaigns.

### 4.3 Metrics

- Likes, comments, and related engagement metrics are **refreshed periodically** (not a one-time snapshot at submission).
- **Estimated reach (v1 definition):** Derived from **follower counts** of the participating student org(s) (and/or connected accounts as implemented), combined with product rules for display.
- **Aggregate likes:** Show **aggregate likes** across the campaign’s linked posts (in addition to or alongside estimated reach, per product copy).
- Brand-facing layout (per-org, UGC, roll-ups): **§5.3**.

---

## 5. Brand experience (PLS)

### 5.1 Onboarding

1. Brand submits **company information** and a **short message** (intent / context for Buzz).
2. A Buzz representative **manually reviews** the submission, then we schedule a call
3. Upon approval, the brand is **onboarded** into the Brand portal.

**Interaction notes:**

- Brand does not self-configure drop logistics in a PLG sense; the rep is the operational owner.

### 5.2 Requesting a drop

1. Brand submits a **drop request**.
2. A Buzz representative handles **agreements, logistics, product shipment, and scheduling** behind the scenes.
3. The brand sees a **read-only status tracker** for these high-level stages (Buzz updates them).

**Brand-facing tracker stages (canonical order):**

1. **Request Received** — _A representative will contact you soon_
2. **Finalizing Agreements** — _Contracts being processed_
3. **Awaiting Products** — _Shipped — tracking number shown_ (when applicable)
4. **Drop Active** — _Campaign is live_
5. **Drop Finished** — _Campaign complete_

**Interactions:**

- Brand users **cannot** advance these tracker stages themselves.
- Tracking number appears when relevant at **Awaiting Products** (and may remain visible where product copy dictates).

#### 5.2.1 Logistics integrations (e.g. EasyPost)

**Today (MVP):** Buzz admins enter tracking numbers on the drop tracker; there is **no** EasyPost (or other carrier) integration in the shipped product.

**Future:** Buzz may integrate shipping and tracking with external providers (for example **EasyPost**) so brands can enter or sync tracking numbers, and eventually generate labels and receive webhook-driven carrier events (e.g. in transit, delivered) where the implementation supports it.

**NOTE:** Exact split of responsibilities (Buzz vs. brand vs. automation) for each milestone should follow the same tracker UX unless the product explicitly hands a step to the brand through the integration.

**TODO:** Finalize EasyPost (or vendor) scope — API keys, webhook surface, who may purchase labels, rate shopping, multi-package drops, org-facing vs. brand-facing tracking parity, and error handling.

### 5.3 Brand dashboard — two views

#### 5.3.1 Per-drop view

When a drop is past the application window (selection / post-window stages such as **finalizing agreements**, or later **active** / **finished**), the brand can open it and sees:

- **Applicants and participants by organization:** Each applying org appears as its own row (or card). Brands **finalize** applicants **after `apply_close_at`**, approving or denying up to capacity (and allocating units when budgeted) — not as rolling mid-window decisions during Open (**§7.1**). Approved orgs remain visible for the lifecycle of the drop.
- **All social posts** linked or submitted for the drop, **grouped by org** where useful, plus roll-up summaries across the drop.
- **Per-post metrics:** likes, comments, estimated reach (per implementation), aligned with platform analytics where applicable.
- **Drop-level KPIs:** total engagement, total reach, **cost per engagement** (if cost inputs exist in the product; otherwise hide or N/A per implementation).

**UGC library (per drop or linked surface):** A single place for the brand to **preview** posts, Reels, and photos contributed for that drop and to **download** approved assets for reuse in the brand’s own marketing.

**TODO (UGC):** Usage rights, consent scope, watermarking, export formats, retention, and moderation / takedown — product and legal to define.

**Interactions:**

- Read-only analytics exploration (filters, date ranges, etc. are optional v2+ unless specified).
- **Applicant finalize** (approve / deny) is available in the post-window selection stage; analytics and library browsing remain read-only except where downloads are explicitly offered. Brands can filter through applicants (sorority, fraternity, sports, academic club, region, etc)
- In the future: there would be a matching algorithm.

#### 5.3.2 Aggregate dashboard

A separate **high-level** view across **all** the brand’s drops:

- **Total reach** and **total engagement** across campaigns.
- **Engagement over time** — chart tracking performance **across drops** (time series).
- **Compare drops** — comparative view (table, chart, or cards — implementation detail).
- **Running totals** — e.g. posts submitted, orgs involved, campuses reached (definitions depend on data captured).

**Interactions:**

- Brand selects time ranges or drops to compare (if offered).
- This view stays **primarily aggregated** across drops; **per-org** detail lives on the **per-drop** campaign surface (§5.3.1).

---

## 6. Organization experience (PLG)

### 6.1 Onboarding

1. Org user chooses **Login with Instagram** using the **organization’s** Instagram Business/Creator account (creates or signs into a Buzz account tied to that Instagram identity; this login account is the org identity — not a personal member account).
2. The app collects **university**, **org name**, and a **university .edu email** address (must match the org’s campus).
3. Buzz sends a **verification** to that **.edu** address; the user completes verification.
4. After **verified .edu** email, the org enters **pending Buzz review** — a Buzz admin manually reviews the org and **approves** or **denies** it.
5. After **Buzz approval**, the user is **granted access** to the Organization portal (Drop Feed, My Campaigns). Denied applicants are notified by **email** and do not gain portal access.

**Access gate:** Portal features are unavailable until step 5 completes. Neither Instagram login nor `.edu` verification alone grants access — Buzz admin approval is required.

**Additional platforms:** Campaign post selection (**§6.4.2**) may require connecting other supported accounts (e.g. TikTok) in addition to the Instagram identity used at login.

### 6.2 Pages

Orgs have **two separate** surfaces:

1. **Drop Feed** — discovery and application; **not** mixed with history.
2. **My Campaigns** — participation history and active campaign management.

---

### 6.3 Drop Feed page

**Purpose:** Browsable catalog of **available** and **upcoming** drops.

Each **drop card** shows:

- Drop details and **brand** identity (as permitted by product).
- **Spots:** first Open window (_“Up to 10 spots”_); after finalize + reopen with prior accepts, depleting leftovers (_“4 of 10 spots remaining”_). Capacity full → **Closed** chip (**§7.2**).
- **Status** for org UX: **Upcoming**, **Open**, **Closed**.

#### 6.3.1 Status: Upcoming

- Before `apply_open_at`, the drop is **Upcoming**.
- Show a **live countdown** to `apply_open_at`.
- **Notify Me** button:
  - Persisted **server-side** as a per-org, per-drop subscription; shows confirmation: _“You’re on the list — we’ll let you know when this opens.”_
  - The org picks a lead time (5 / 15 / 60 minutes before `apply_open_at`).

**Interactions:**

- Tapping **Notify Me** records the subscription on the backend; revisits show the already-subscribed state from the server.
- Org may opt out (remove the subscription) before `apply_open_at`.
- **Delivery:** a reminder email goes to the org's `.edu` address once the chosen lead time is reached, sent at most once per subscription. The scheduler runs every ~5 minutes, so the shortest lead time can land a few minutes late. Push is still out of scope (**§11**).

#### 6.3.2 Status: Open

- After `apply_open_at` and before closure conditions, the drop is **Open** (subject to `apply_close_at` and not closed for other reasons — **§4.1**). Orgs may **Apply** while Open; applications stay pending until batch finalize (**§7.1**).
- **Spots line:** first Open (`acceptedCount === 0`) shows capacity as _“Up to N spots”_ (accepts do not deplete during the first window). A **reopened** window with prior accepts may show _“M of N spots remaining”_. At capacity on the feed: **§7.2** (post-selection / reopen leftovers — not mid-window accepts).

#### 6.3.3 Status: Closed

- **Closed** when: `apply_close_at` has passed (unless manually reopened), capacity is filled per **§7.2** (after selection, or reopen with prior accepts), Buzz manually closed the drop, or other admin actions. **Reopen:** **§4.1**. Capacity fill alone does **not** close a first-window Open drop before finalize.

**Interactions:**

- **Apply** is not available.
- **Notify Me** may be hidden or irrelevant depending on state (product decision: typically only for Upcoming).

---

### 6.4 My Campaigns page

**Purpose:** History of all drops the org has **interacted with** (applications, acceptances, active, finished — see below).

- **Sort:** Active campaigns **first**, then others (e.g. by recency).

#### 6.4.1 Org-facing campaign stages

Each campaign shows a **status** in this progression:

1. **Applied**
2. **Accepted** — _Awaiting product_ (tracking number shown when available)
3. **Active** — _Drop is live_
4. **Finished**

Drop-level denial (brand): **§7.1**.

**Interactions:**

- Tap a campaign to open **campaign detail** appropriate to status.

#### 6.4.2 When a campaign is Active — campaign detail

The org can:

- **Select** which of **their** social posts **relate to this drop** (subject to the **one-post-one-campaign** rule).
- See an **aggregate engagement score** across all **selected** posts for that campaign.

**Data flow implication:**

- That aggregate feeds **directly into** the **brand’s per-drop dashboard** (along with other orgs’ contributions), attributed **per org** for management and UGC (§5.3.1).

---

## 7. Applications, acceptance, and capacity — rules

Each drop has **fixed org capacity** and an **application window** (**§4.1**). **§7.1**–**§7.3** define applicant review, capacity exhaustion on the feed, and concurrent participation. **Upcoming / Open / Closed** on the org feed follow **§4.1** and **§6.3**.

### 7.1 Application flow (org → brand)

**No waitlist** — each applicant is either pending review, approved, or denied. **Collect-all-then-pick:** there are **no accept writes while `now <= apply_close_at`** in v1.

1. Org submits **Apply** on an **Open** drop (if allowed by time + state; **§4.1**, **§6.3**). Applications stay pending through the window.
2. After `apply_close_at`, the **brand** **batch-finalizes** applicants for that drop (typically in the post-window selection stage).
3. For each applicant the brand **approves** or **denies**:
   - **Approved** — counts toward capacity; if the drop has a `total_product_units` budget (**§4.1**), the brand also **allocates units per approved org**, with the sum of allocations capped by the budget. Org moves to **Accepted** in **My Campaigns** when product rules expose that state (subject to fulfillment and activation).
   - **Denied** — **no** row in **My Campaigns** for that application; **email** only.

### 7.2 Capacity exhaustion

- When brand-**approved** orgs (via finalize) **fill** all spots:
  - Drop shows as **Closed** on the **Drop Feed** (org cannot apply as Open; no waitlist).
- That Closed state is **post-selection**, or on a **reopened** window with prior accepts already counting toward capacity — **not** a first-window Open path (accepts do not accumulate while the chronological window is still open).

### 7.3 Concurrent participation

- An org **may** hold **brand-approved** spots on **multiple drops** simultaneously.
- Any **future** limits (e.g. max concurrent campaigns) are **TBD by Buzz** and not enforced in this v1 spec unless added later.

---

## 8. Data flow and aggregation

```
Orgs apply while Open; after apply_close_at, brand batch-finalizes (§7.1)
              ↓
Accepted orgs submit / link posts for the drop
              ↓
Buzz pulls / refreshes metrics per post (likes, comments, reach estimates)
              ↓
Per-org + roll-up  →  Brand per-drop view (applicants, posts, UGC library)
Aggregated all drops →  Brand aggregate dashboard
                     →  Engagement over time chart
```

**Org-visible data:**

- Org sees **its own** posts and **its** aggregate for the campaign.
- Org does **not** see other orgs’ posts or brand-global totals (unless explicitly added later).

---

## 9. Status authority

- **Brand:** Batch-finalize (approve/deny) drop applicants **after `apply_close_at`** (**§7.1**). Org moves **Applied → Accepted** after brand approval (labels may differ by surface).
- **Buzz:** Brand **platform** onboarding; **drop-request** tracker stages (**§5.2**); agreements and ops coordination; **§4.1** reopen; **org** lifecycle beyond applicant choice (e.g. **Active** / **Finished** when fulfillment and campaign rules are met — triggers TBD with brands). Org **portal access** is gated by **.edu** verification **followed by Buzz admin approval** (**§6.1**).
- **Automation / rules:** Feed **Open/Closed** follows **§4.1**, **§6.3**, **§7.2** (capacity-Closed is post-selection / reopen leftovers, not mid-window accept).

---

## 10. Interaction matrix (quick reference)

| Actor | Surface             | Primary actions                                                                                                                  |

| Brand | Drop request        | Submit request; view read-only tracker                                                                                           |
| Brand | Per-drop dashboard  | Batch-finalize applicants after close; per-org posts + metrics; drop KPIs; UGC preview/download                                |
| Brand | Aggregate dashboard | Totals, time series, compare drops, running totals                                                                               |
| Org   | Onboarding          | Login with org Instagram account; university + org name + **.edu**; verify email → Buzz approval → access                                                    |
| Org   | Drop Feed           | Browse; countdown + Notify Me (server subscription); Apply                                                                                     |
| Org   | My Campaigns        | Track status; manage posts when Active                                                                                           |
| Buzz  | Admin (conceptual)  | Platform org/brand onboarding; move brand tracker stages; timing/reopen/fulfillment coordination; integrations (see §5.2.1 TODO) |

---

## 11. Non-goals and v1 scope boundaries

- **Notify Me push notifications:** Out of scope — reminder delivery is **email only** (**§6.3.1**).
- **In-app denial UI for orgs:** Out of scope — channel is **email**; rules **§7.1** (drop applicant denials).
- **Rich drop scheduling beyond apply window:** Only `apply_open_at` and `apply_close_at` specified for v1; other timestamps may be implicit inside Buzz ops.

---

## 12. Open product decisions (explicitly TBD)

- Future **policy limits** on how many concurrent drops an org may hold.
- Exact **cost per engagement** inputs and formulas.
- Admin tooling UX for **reopen**, exception handling, and Buzz override paths (if any) when a brand is unresponsive.
- Whether **tracking numbers** surface in multiple places simultaneously (brand tracker vs. org campaign).
- Shipping (**§5.2.1** TODO) and **UGC** policy (**§5.3.1** TODO): detail lives in those subsections, not duplicated here.
